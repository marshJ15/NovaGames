YOU MAY NEED TO DO THIS AT HOME AND SAVE THE LINKS IF ANYTHING IS BLOCKED




1. Make a GitHub account (https://github.com)
2. Go to https://github.com/cosmosc0des/N0VA and click "fork"
3. Go to https://codesandbox.io and click "deploy from github repo"
4. Your link will be in the top bar on the right side!
5. Repeat whenever!

YOU NOW  HAVE INFINITE LINKS!

MY JOB IS TO WRITE THE CODE, NOT DEPLOY IT FOR YOU, DO NOT DM ASKING FOR LINKS!

YOU MAY NEED TO DO THIS AT HOME AND SAVE THE LINKS IF ANYTHING IS BLOCKED




1. Make a GitHub account (https://github.com)
2. Go to https://github.com/cosmosc0des/NovaGames and click "fork"
3. Go to https://vercel.app and create and account.
4. Deploy from your forked Github repo.
5. Your link will generate.
6. Repeat whenever!

YOU NOW  HAVE INFINITE LINKS!

MY JOB IS TO WRITE THE CODE, NOT DEPLOY IT FOR YOU, DO NOT DM ASKING FOR LINKS!
